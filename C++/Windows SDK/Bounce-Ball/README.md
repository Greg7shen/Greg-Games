# Bounce Ball

Here is a simple game produced by C++.</br>
I firmly believe that this program is so easy to read that I don't want to put any comments in here.</br>
If you have free time to play, I could tell you some details about this game.<.br>

## What's the goal of this game?
The user control the board beneath the scree to protect the falling ball not falling out of the screen.</br>
You can see that the "____" is the so-called board.</br>
And the character which has horizental speed is what we called ball.</br>
The longer you control the ball, the better you have played.</br>

## How to play?
You can only press A and D to move to left side and right side.</br>
Remember not to let the board move out of the screen, which will cause undeined error.</br>

## Which part is the most interesing?
I add a part called buff. The buffs <b>only</b> appear at the beginning of the game.</br>
That's to say, if you missed them carelessly, you won't have the chance to catch them any more.</br>
There are 2 kinds of buffs in this game.</br>
One is to make the board longer.</br>
The other is to slow down the ball.(Actually, the latter don't work really well)</br>
You will understand it when you start playing.</br>

## What's more:
Remember the game itself is hard to playing(and of course it is not funny any more). Good luck!</br>
