# Flappy Bird

This game is much more like the game we created before. It is shown on the console and of course it is pretty much simple with some bugs. Now I'll tell you how to play this game.

## How to play?

In this game, player will play a role in what we called flappy bird. But actually, it is quite different from the normal flappy bird game. 

The '@' on the left side of the screen is our player. And the obstacles that continuously comes are what our players are trying to deal with. You can see every obstacle has a random size hole in the random position . You goal is control the bird to move upside and downside to cross the hole so that it won't collide into the hard obstacle. **The more time you have insist, the better you have played**.
