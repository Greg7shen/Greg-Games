# Fighting
This is a simple game created by python module--pygame.
Here is a instruction for users:

## What hell are the two stupid guys!?

At the beginning of the game, you can choose a player depending on yourself.
And the role on the left hand side is so-called player1.
Similarly, the role on the right is called player2.

## How do I control these two fucking roles?

For player1, you can press W, A, S, D for moving.
And the player could attack or release his skill by pressing SPACE or X on the keyboard.
As for player2, your can press ↑, ↓, ←, → to make the role move in four directions.

## What's the meaning of this shit game!?

Honestly speaking, I add some interesting element in there. It's also necessary for the player to attack or release his skill, whick requiring the user to press 0 and ENTER on the key-pad.
When a player is defeated, the game is over. But if any of them wants to play again, you can press 'R' to restart.
