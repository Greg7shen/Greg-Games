BAS's Games
==========
As is known to all, some classic , and simple game program is perhaps the best way to practice our programming skills .
On the one hand, it is easy to produce,
On the other hand, once we create a new game, not only the game gives us a lot of joy,
but also the process itself brings more fun. 
This repository is created in order to 
* Study the language itself, especially its syntax.
* Using class to produce more complex games.
* Lean a little about game-programming.
And at the same time, enjoy the programming.

<b>The repository will include:</b>

C/C++
-----
  Console Games:This kind of game won't rely on any third party of library. They are really easy to produce, but it don't look so good<br/>
  EasyX Games: In this part I'll use the easyX to produce more colorful, more beautiful games.
  
Python
-----
  Pygames: Of course pygame is one of the most famous and perhaps the easiest library to use. You can see it in the <I>Python Crash Course</I>
           Some people may also surprise to see that children who have not reached 10 years old are learning this library. So I'd like to try it as well.</br>
  PyQt: I haven't done it yet, but the Qt is the most famous GUI library in the Python. So why not have a try?
  
JavaScript
----------
I promise it will be created later.
